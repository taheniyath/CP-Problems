# dicetoorderedhand(a, b, c) [5pts]
# Write the function dicetoorderedhand(a, b, c) that takes 3 dice and
# returns them in a hand, which is a 3-digit integer. However, even if the
# dice are unordered, the resulting hand must be ordered so that the largest
# die is on the left and smallest die is on the right. For example:
# assert(dicetoorderedhand(1,2,3) == 321)
# assert(dicetoorderedhand(6,5,4) == 654)
# assert(dicetoorderedhand(1,4,2) == 421)
# assert(dicetoorderedhand(6,5,6) == 665)
# assert(dicetoorderedhand(2,2,2) == 222)
# Hint: You can use max(a,b,c) to find the largest of 3 values, and
# min(a,b,c) to find the smallest.

def dicetoorderedhand(a, b, c):
	# your code goes here
	s = a+b+c
	if(a==b==c):
		return (a,b,c)
	else:
		k1 = (max(a,b,c))
		k3 = (min(a,b,c))
		k2 = s-k1+k3
		return (k1, k2, k3)
	# pass
